These Terms of Use govern your use of Totaljerkface, and by using and participating in Totaljerkface, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use.  For purposes of these Terms of Use, the term "Affiliates" means, with respect to Fancy Force, any person or entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, Fancy Force.</p>
            <p>Without limiting the foregoing, your Totaljerkface customer account(s) and participation in Totaljerkface are governed by these Terms of Use.  Our Web sites and service offerings are always evolving, so it is important that you periodically check here, as well as the specific rules for any games or activities in which you choose to participate, for updates. If we revise these Terms of Use, such revision(s) will take effect immediately upon being posted on Totaljerkface.  As with our Privacy Policy, if you do not agree to any of these Terms of Use, you should discontinue using or participating in Totaljerkface.</p>
            <h4 class="h4header">ACCOUNT REGISTRATION</h4>
